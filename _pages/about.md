I am a quant and model developer at a large financial institution, focussing on risk analytics and management. In the past I was a a *gravitational-wave astrophysicist* using data, statistics and astrophysics to understand the origin of black holes, and using general relativity to model the complex dynamics of black holes as they rotate around each other.


I am deeply passionate about learning new statistical techniques and topics. Currently, I am very interested in risk analytics, statistical modelling for financial institutions, and portfolio analytics.

### My trajectory

I am currently a quant/risk manager at a large financial institution, where I have covered a variety of roles from model validation to model development teams.

I was a *postdoctoral fellow* in [Emanuele Berti](https://pages.jh.edu/eberti2/)'s group at Johns Hopkins University, where I regularly interact with bright students and colleagues. 

I have defended my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Potsdam, Germany), where I have worked under the supervision of [Alessandra Buonanno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandra_Buonanno).
There I have spent 4 wonderful years, and met many friends and current collaborators. I have also thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful lakes around Golm.

Before that I earned my master in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Oxford, my BSc in Physics at King's College London, and my diploma in humanities at the Liceo Classico in Perugia, perked in the wonderful hills of Umbria.
