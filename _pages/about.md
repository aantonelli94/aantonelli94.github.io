### What am I?

I am a *gravitational-wave astrophysicist*, and I think about gravity, black holes, and neutron stars quite a bit. In my book, it does not get any more exciting that this! 

My expertise is in analytical relativity and gravitational-wave source modelling, but I also like to work with data. I am interested in the black-hole astrophysics and cosmology that we can learn from gravitational-wave observations. Part of my work is devoted to develop statistical tools to maximise the scientific return from such observations.

In this page you can find more about my research by browsing through my [publications](https://aantonelli94.github.io/publications/), peeking into my [talks](https://aantonelli94.github.io/talks/) (and [classes](https://aantonelli94.github.io/teaching/)  I've tutored), or by checking a [portfolio](https://aantonelli94.github.io/portfolio/) with a more extensive description of my work.

### Where am/was I?

Currently I am a *postdoctoral fellow* in Emanuele Berti's group at Johns Hopkins University, where I regularly interact with bright students and colleagues. If not at work, you can probably find me hiking in some nearby mountains.

Before my postdoc, I have defended my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Potsdam, Germany), where I have worked under the supervision of Alessandra Buonanno.
There I have spent 4 wonderful years, and met many friends and current collaborators. I have also thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful lakes around Golm!

Before that I was a master student at the University of Oxford, a BSc student at King's College London, and a student at the Liceo Classico in Perugia, perked in the wonderful hills of Umbria, my forever hometown.
