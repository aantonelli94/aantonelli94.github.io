------------------

Gravitational waves (GW) travel throughout the Universe, unimpeded. They are around us all the time, carrying information about the sources that generate them. When these sources are very compact and massive, much like black holes or neutron stars, the GWs are loud enough to be detected on Earth with dedicated machines.

Since the first detection of the GWs from a coalescing binary formed of two black holes, back in 2015, the field of gravitational-wave astronomy has exploded. We have reached a point in which the ever-increasing number of observations allows us to infer the astrophysical origin of black holes or precisely measure the Hubble constant. It is expected that, with future detectors (the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer on Earth, or the spaceborne LISA mission), thousands upon thousands of signals from coalescing binaries will be detected. This is great, as we can keep on improving our understanding of the astrophysics of black holes and Cosmology with a growing dataset.

To maximise the scientific return of current as well as future detectors, GW astrophysicists need to work on three broad (and interacting) fronts: the **theory of gravity**, **astrophysics**, and **statistical analyses**.

Unsurprisingly, the **theory of gravity** needs to be studied in excruciating detail. Within certain schemes, solutions to the general-relativistic equations of motions can be obtained. This is the bedrock to develop waveform predictions, themselves the pillars of GW *source modelling*. This theme also includes studying potential *modifications* to the underlying theories of gravity, because you never know.

The **astrophysics** of black holes also needs to be studied, to understand what we may expect to find in detectors' data. This area may include understanding the formation scenarios of black holes and neutron stars,  the populations of galactic binaries in the Milky Way, or even the environments of the gargantuan supermassive black holes at the centre of most galaxies.

Finally, **statistics** is the language used to interpret the data coming out of detectors and unlock the Science described above. Statistical analyses need to be absolutely on point to avoid misinterpreting data and inferring the wrong science.


In my work, I try to connect some of the dots between gravity, astrophysics and statistical analyses. In any given day I may find myself modelling waveforms, discussing the astrophysics of given sources, or statistical tools. Most likely, though, a combination of the three.
