### Lay summary

------------------

Gravitational waves (GW) travel throughout the Universe, unimpeded. They are around us all the time, carrying information about the sources that generate them. When these sources are very compact and massive (think: black holes and neutron stars) the GWs are loud enough to be detected on Earth with dedicated machines.

Since the first detection of the GWs from a coalescing binary formed of two black holes, back in 2015, the field of gravitational-wave astronomy has exploded. While we are already basking in the "bright" of hundreds of events, it is expected that future detectors will reveal thousands upon thousands more. This ever-increasing dataset is and will continue to be a trove of astrophysical and cosmological information.

To maximise the scientific return of current as well as future detectors, GW astrophysicists need to work on three broad (and interacting) fronts: the **theory of gravity**, **astrophysics**, and **statistical analyses**. In my work, I try to connect some of the dots between these. In any given day I may find myself modelling waveforms, discussing the astrophysics of GW sources, or trying to come up with robust statistical techniques. Most likely, though, a combination of the three.

### For the curious

------------------


General relativity, the **theory of gravity**, must be studied in excruciating detail. Within certain schemes, solutions to the general-relativistic equations of motions can be obtained. This is the bedrock to develop waveform predictions, themselves the pillars of GW *source modelling*. 

>My work exploits the synergies between approximation schemes to solve the Einstein equations to improve the accuracy attainable in waveform predictions. The approximations I am concerned with are the post-Newtonian, post-Minkowskian and small-mass ratio ones (the latter based on gravitational self-force theory). I have also made extensive use of the effective-one-body formalism to connect all three approaches.

Lost in the elegance of the black-hole solutions to the Einstein equations, it is sometimes easy to forget that such objects are very much **astrophysical**. In fact, predictions for the rates at which black holes form are useful to understand what we may expect to find in current detectors' data. Moreover, with the future LISA detector we expect to discover many signals from sources that are currently studied only electromagnetically.

>In my research I focus on LISA sources from an astrophysical standpoint. I am in particular interested in the effects of *accretion disks around supermassive black holes*, and whether they could have an observational impact on detectable sources or on galaxy formation. I am also interested in using  the thousands of *galactic binaries* we expect to detect with LISA as precise probes to test general relativity.

**Statistics** is the language used to interpret the data coming out of detectors, and can broadly be divided into two philosophies: the frequentist and Bayesian. 

>I exploit both frequentist and Bayesian statistics to develop robust tools to address current and future data analyses. I am particularly interested in understanding how to deal with many sources at once, which is both needed to extract the parameters of individual sources with future detectors, and to extract astrophysical and cosmological population-level parameters with currently available data.
