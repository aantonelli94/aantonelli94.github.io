# Glossary


The LISA detector is a spaceborne mission that will fly to space sometime in the 2030's.
It is expected to detect thousands of signals, among which we hope to find a handful of *extreme-mass-ratio inspirals* (EMRIs). 


EMRIs are binaries in which one compact object is much more massive than the companion. With the LISA detector, we may observe the inspiral of a stellar-mass compact object onto a supermassive black hole. These act as probes of the environments or any potential deviations to general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole.


The LISA mission will also unravel thousands of white-dwarf binaries in our very own galaxy. Some of these sources are loud enough to *have already been detected* with electromagnetic astrophysics. The loudness of these binaries could help explore the environments of the Milky Way, or reveal any modifications to gravity.

# Projects


- We are exploring the effect of the accretion disks surrounding the central black holes in the centre of most galaxies. There are several effects of interest: planetary-type migration, winds, or dynamical friction.

- We are interested in understanding whether gravitational-wave observations can detect the presence of dark-matter spikes, namely overdensities in the distribution of galactic dark-matter halos. This line of work has implications for detecting new Physics beyond the Standard Model, or constraining dark-matter models.

- We investigate whether galactic binaries in the Milky Way could be used to test modifications to gravity, such as those that predict a time dependence to the gravitational constant.
