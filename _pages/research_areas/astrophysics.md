# Glossary


The LISA detector is a spaceborne mission that will fly to space sometime in the 2030's.
It is expected to detect thousands of signals, among which we hope to find a handful of *extreme-mass-ratio inspirals* (EMRIs). 


EMRIs are binaries in which one compact object is much more massive than the companion. With the LISA detector, we may observe the inspiral of a stellar-mass compact object onto a supermassive black hole. These act as probes of the environments or any potential deviations to general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole.

# Projects


- Collaborators and I are exploring the effect of the accretion disks surrounding the central black holes in the centre of most galaxies. There are several effects of interest, coming from planetary-type migration, winds, or dynamical friction.
