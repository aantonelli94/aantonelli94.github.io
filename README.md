Forked version of the "academicpages" [source code](https://academicpages.github.io). I have removed a lot of stuff from the templates to have a more minimalistic code.

Shoutout to [this legend](https://jayrobwilliams.com) for the various nice tutorials on how to setup the page. I highly recommend you check out [his posts](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/08/website-content/).
