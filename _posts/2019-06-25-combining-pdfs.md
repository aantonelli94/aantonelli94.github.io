Wow, what can I say? I just defended my PhD thesis and thus concluded a big chapter of my life, and surely of my academic life. I want to thank all the people in Potsdam for the great years, the banter and, of course, the amazing research we carried out. 

Now a well deserved vacation, and onto a new adventure in Baltimore!
